<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
A common sight in shops is a grid of LEDs where text scrolls
across the grid, something like ...
</p>
<center><img src="./Assignment Outline/scroll.gif"></center>
<p>
The aim of this assignment is to complete a MIPS program that
can scroll alphabetic text strings like the above video.
</p>

<h2>Setting Up</h2>
<p>
Create a private directory for doing the assignment, and put the
assignment files in it by running the following command:
</p>
<pre>$ <b>unzip <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/18s2/assignments/assign1/assign1.zip">/home/cs1521/web/18s2/assignments/assign1/assign1.zip</a></b>
</pre>
<p>
If you're working on this at home, download the ZIP file and
create the files on your home machine.
It's fine to work on your own machine but remember to
<em>always</em> test your code on the CSE machines before
submitting.
</p>
<p>
The above command will create the following files:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><tt>Makefile</tt></dt>
<dd><p>
A file to control compilation of <tt>scroll.c</tt>.
It is not critical for the MIPS assembler part:
it creates the executable C program to give you an exemplar,
and can produce the <tt>exe.s</tt> file.
</p></dd>
<dt><tt>scroll.c</tt></dt>
<dd><p>
A complete solution, written in C. Your goal is to write a MIPS
assembler program to copy the behaviour of this program.
</p></dd>
<dt><tt>chars.h</tt></dt>
<dd><p>
The array of big characters used in producing the scrolling text.
This is <tt>#include</tt>'d in <tt>scroll.c</tt>.
</p></dd>
<dt><tt>scroll.s</tt></dt>
<dd><p>
A partly complete solution to the assignment, written in MIPS assembler.
</p></dd>
<dt><tt>chars.s</tt></dt>
<dd><p>
A MIPS version of the array of big characters used in producing
the scrolling text. This file requires no modification.
</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>
Initially, it would be worth compiling the C program and running
it on some examples to get a feel for its behaviour.
The compiled C program, called <tt>scroll</tt>, expects a single
command-line argument: the text string to be scrolled.
</p><p>
You can compile and run the C program (<tt>scroll</tt>) as follows:
</p>
<pre>$ <b>make</b>
gcc -g -Wall -Werror -std=c99    scroll.c   -o scroll
$ <b>./scroll</b>
Usage: ./scroll String
$ <b>./scroll "It's fun"</b>
Only letters and spaces are allowed in the string!
$ <b>./scroll abc def</b>
<span class="comment">... scrolls "abc"; it only uses the first commond-line argument</span>
$ <b>./scroll "Hello there"</b>
<span class="comment">... scrolls "Hello there", like the above video</span>
</pre>

<h2>The Program</h2>
<p>
What the scrolling program should do, whether implemented in MIPS or C:
</p>
<ul>
<li> check the command-line argument (&lt; 100 chars, only letters and spaces) </li>
<li> create a buffer containing big versions of the characters in <tt>argv[1]</tt> </li>
<li> add part of the content of the big-char buffer into the display buffer, starting at <tt>starting_pos</tt> </li>
<li> write the contents of the display buffer to standard output </li>
<li> repeat, moving one column to the left each time, until the message scrolls of the left of the display </li>
</ul>
<p>
Both the C and the MIPS programs are structured the same,
with a <tt>main</tt> function to handle the command-line
arguments and then run the scrolling.
The programs also have the same set of lower-level functions.
In <tt>scroll.c</tt>, there are comments describing the purpose of
each function and the code is hopefully clear enough that you can
understand how each function works.
</p>
<p>
The diagram below shows the major data structures used by the programs:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>theString[100]</tt> holds a copy of the string from <tt>argv[1]</tt> </li>
<li> <tt>bigString[9][1000]</tt> holds a copy of <tt>theString</tt> in big characters and with one column of space between adjacent big characters </li>
<li> <tt>display[9][80]</tt> is where characters are placed before being written out to the screen</li>
<li> <tt>all_chars[52*9*9]</tt> array containing representation of 'A'-'Z' and 'a'-'z' as big chars &nbsp;
	<small>(not shown in the diagram; defined in the <code>chars.s</code> file)</small>
</li></ul>
<center><img src="./Assignment Outline/data-structs.png"></center>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>
The aim of this exercise is to complete the supplied MIPS program skeleton
(in the file <tt>scroll.s</tt>) to behave exactly like the C program
(in <tt>scroll.c</tt>).
You should not change the <tt>chars.s</tt> file; treat its contents as a
read-only data structure.
</p>
<p>
In <tt>scroll.s</tt> each function has comments to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> indicate which registers the function uses </li>
<li> indicate which registers the function overwrites (clobbers) </li>
<li> give a mapping between local variables in the C code and registers in MIPS </li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that these are suggestions only; you can use whatever registers
you like, provided that you save and restore any <tt>$s?</tt>
registers that you overwrite in the function code.
And, of course, provided that the code behaves the same as the C code.
</p>
<p>
To save you some time, we have included function prologues and epilogues
in some functions.
These save and restore registers <tt>$fp</tt>, <tt>$ra</tt>, and any <tt>$s?</tt>
registers that the function happens to use, and also maintain the stack.
You can use these as templates for how to implement the prologue and
epilogue in the functions that do not provide them.
</p><p>
Some of the functions from <tt>scroll.s</tt> are already implemented,
but others require you to write MIPS assembler for them.
Here's a rundown of the functions in <tt>scroll.s</tt> and their status:
</p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr><td><tt>main</tt></td>
<td>
Partly complete, including the epilogue and prologue, and the
command-line argument checking.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>setUpDisplay</tt></td>
<td>
Function prologue and epilogue ok. ToDo: function body.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>showDisplay</tt></td>
<td>
Function prologue and epilogue ok. ToDo: function body.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>delay</tt></td>
<td>
Already complete, but you can tweak the numbers if you want,
to speed up or slow down the animation.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>isUpper</tt></td>
<td>
ToDo: function prologue and epilogue, and function body.
</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>isLower</tt></td>
<td>
Already complete (and makes isUpper very easy).
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<h3>Running the program</h3>
<p>
Note that <tt>scroll.s</tt> is not stand-alone MIPS program;
it requires access to the <tt>all_chars[]</tt> array in the
file <tt>chars.s</tt>.
In order to run the program (either via <tt>spim</tt> or
<tt>qtspim</tt>), you'll need to combine the two files.
Here's an example of you might run the program using <tt>spim</tt>:
</p>
<pre>$ <b>cat chars.s scroll.s &gt; exe.s</b>
$ <b>spim -file exe.s</b>
<span class="comment">... program executes ...</span>
</pre>
<p>
The file <tt>exe.s</tt> <em>is</em> a complete program that
can be loaded into <tt>qtspim</tt> as well.
You will need to do the <tt>cat</tt> step each time you change
the <tt>scroll.s</tt> file and want to test it.
The <tt>Makefile</tt> knows how to create this file too.
</p>

<h3>Errata</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong class="red">2018-08-19 14:30</strong> (revision 1.5)<ul>
      <li>in revision 1.3, one instance of <var>ch</var> was not moved.</li>
      <li>in all epilogues except <code>delay</code>,
        <code>$sp</code> was reloaded with LW, not LA.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong class="brown">2018-08-18 18:50</strong> (revision 1.4)<ul>
      <li>in <code>main</code>,
        translation of <code>break</code> directive was incorrect
        at <code>main_ch_ok</code>+3;
        <code>blt</code> used instead of <code>bge</code>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong class="brown">2018-08-18 17:20</strong> (revision 1.3)<ul>
      <li>in <code>main</code>,
        variable <var>ch</var> moved
        from register <code>$t0</code> to <code>$s2</code>,
        with corresponding changes to stack frame.</li>
      <li>in <code>main</code>,
        logic of calls to <code>isUpper</code>, <code>isLower</code>,
        and comparison with space was corrected.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong class="brown">2018-08-18 08:50</strong> (revision 1.2)<ul>
      <li>in <code>main</code>,
        argument load was done with LA not LW.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>(Worth kudos, but no marks)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Make the scroll repeat. If you wait until the whole message scrolls off
the left hand end, this is easy. Make it do a "continuous scroll", where
the message starts repeating from the right before when the end of the
right-hand end of the message has moved 10 columns from the right-hand
end of the display.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Change the colours of the '#' characters as they scroll. Make the colour
change as aesthetically pleasing as possible.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p>
You just need to submit the <tt>scroll.s</tt> file. You can do this either
through Webcms3 or using <tt>give</tt>.
You must submit your work before midnight on Sunday 2nd September.
</p>

<p>
Have fun, &nbsp; <i>jas</i>
