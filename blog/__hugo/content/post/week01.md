Finally, courses 'start' to delve into the cool part of computing!

Let's redefine how we can use numbers!

Logical Operators
AND | `a && b`
OR  | `a || b`
EQ  | `a == b`
GT  | `a > b`
GTE | `a >= b`
LT  | `a < b`
LTE | `a <= b`

Bitwise Operators
AND | `a & b`
OR  | `a & b`
XOR | `a ^ b`
NEG | `~a`
LSHIFT | `a << n`, where `n` is an integer
RSHIFT | `a >> n`, where `n` is an integer
If signed, sign bit replaced left-end bit

How the bitwise operators differ to the logical operators, is that the bitwise operators compare the individual bits of the operands and can return a non-binary answer, whilst the logical operators only returns a `1` for true, or a `0` for false.

For `LSHIFT` and `RSHIFT`, mathematically we are multiplying / dividing by 2^n
