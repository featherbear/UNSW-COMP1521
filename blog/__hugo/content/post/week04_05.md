Let's get low(er) level!

# Stack Frames
When a stack frames is set up, the values of the specified registers are copied into the stack.  
This allows the register values to be modified, as, at the end of the function, we can restore the original values that we started with.  

Not all functions require a stack frame though. You only need to use one if:  

* You are using the `$s?` registers  
  The safe registers are, by convention, registers that can only be modified by the function it is used in, and not any other function.
* You are calling another function within your function  
  If you perform `jal func` inside your function, the return address to the main function would get lost

Upon finishing the MIPS part of COMP1521, here's a few things that I've found amusing.  

# There are ten temporary registers
In MIPS, registers `$8 - $15` are given the common name `$t0 - $t7`.  
**BUT WAIT THERE'S TWO MORE**, `$24 - $25` which are `$t8 - $t9`.  
I guess that would have been good to know for the assignment


# Labels point to a memory address
Let's consider the label `display`, which points to a memory space of 720 bytes...
```
    .data
display: 
    .space 720
```

What if we wanted to store something into space 101?
```
    .text
main:
    li  $t0, 100        # t0 = 100
    la  $t1, display    # t1 = base address of `display`
    add $t2, $t1, $t0   # t2 = base + 100
    li  $t9, 'A'        # t9 = 'A'
    
    sb  $t9, ($t2)      # *(base + 100) = 'A'
```

We could *also* do this
```
    .text
main:
    li  $t0, 100        # t0 = 100
    li  $t9, 'A'        # t9 = 'A'
    
    sb  $t9, base($t0)      # *(100 + base) = 'A'
```
This way saved two instructions, but more importantly, it used one less register...  
And that means more places to do more things - hooray!  

# Useful debugging
I'm not a fan of debugging software ~because I haven't been bothered to learn how to use them~ so I often don't use the useful features like breakpoints and step by step execution.  
Instead, what I - and alot of people would do, is to just print out text at certain points.  
In MIPS, you can't print a string directly, rather you need to have created the string in the data segment of the code
```
    .data
test: .ascii "foo bar"

...

    .text
la $a0, test
li $v0, 4
syscall
```

If you wanted to print a single character
```
li $a0, 'X'
li $v0, 11
syscall
```

Or maybe an integer
```
li $a0, 999
li $v0, 1
syscall
```
