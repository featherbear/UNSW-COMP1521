      <description>First assignment for COMP1521 2018s2! [View Files Here]
Task This assignment was to write a scrolling display program in MIPS. We were meant to &amp;lsquo;translate&amp;rsquo; the supplied working C code into its MIPS assembly equivalent, but I missed that piece of information and dived right into the assignment.
The starting MIPS code, was&amp;hellip; convoluted&amp;hellip;
Comparing the provided isLower function, the isUpper function I wrote is about 66% shorter.
So in a sense, it comforts me that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t translating the provided C code.</description>
